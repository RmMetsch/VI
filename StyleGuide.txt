To make sure the code does not turn into a spaghetti sauce we need some style guidelines, open a issue if style is not consistent somewhere. 

Please use the following style guide when submitting a pull request,

functions will be lowerCamelCase e.g.
function myNiceFunction
	dosomethings
end

Variables will be lowerCamelCase e.g.
myCoolVariable = 10;

Structs and its fields will be UpperCase to distinguish them from variables
VeryNiceStruct.Property = 3

Classes will be lowerCamelCase e.g.
voltageProbe
currentProbe
etc

Class Properties will be UpperCase
Points
RawData
etc

general style guidelines: 
- avoid overnesting, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFRhGnuXG-4&t=252s , watch this video on how not to nest code, let me know where code is unnecesarily nested.
- avoid loops in favour of vector oppperations 
- use consistent white space, 
  	somecode, othercode	
	(4 + 4)/(4 - 10)
	a = 3.1415 
- Close lines with ;
- Make sure code is scalable and easy to use. Use constructs as varargin with some if statements to handle complex cases. 
- Add faulty input warnings using disp at start of function, e.g. 
	if somethingsIsWrong 
		disp("you fucked up, change this thing")
		return
	end
